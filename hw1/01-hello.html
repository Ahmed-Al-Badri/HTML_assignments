          My name is Ahmed Al-Badri and am a student in this class term which
          is Winter 2024, this term might be a good term becasue of the topics
          being taught in other classes and this class. However, during the
          choicing of the terms classes, there seemed to be many classes to take,
          and since this is the third year, more Computer Science classes became
          open.
